<h2>SKELETIME</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: I tested the game in multiple browsers and the sound wouldn't play in Chrome. The sound DOES play normally in Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer.</strong></li>	
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This a multiplayer reaction time game. Although the assets were taken from various artists and developers, the final product has a very cohesive feel. There's something to be said for carefully combining and remixing premade assets. The idea of a quickdraw game is nothing new, but I hope the presentation makes up for the simple concept. The name of the game is a dumb pun.   
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The visual and sound design were the main focus for this game. Implementing animations and spritesheets, editing in slightly different death sounds, and loading in a custom font all represent a clear improvement over my first assignment. The game also includes a timer that randomizes itself and a nifty restart button.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I made a lot of strides in terms of exploring the capabilities of phaser and learned many more functions including ones dealing with animation management, sound implementation, and advanced text options. I'd say one of the hardest part of the assignment was finding a way to use a custom font in the game. I had to link to a css file and adjust the index.html. I also had a lot of trouble switching between different animations and getting the timer to render properly.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The code for this game was adjusted from a number of phaser examples. There are a few too many to link so I'll simply list the titles of the examples they are filed under on the phaser website. I also used this <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/28424-solved-loading-custom-fonts-and-displaying-cyrillicfrenchturkish-characters/">forum discussion</a> as a code template for using custom fonts.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Leverage your reaction time and destroy your skeletal opponent, but be wary not to attack prematurely and fall on your own metaphorical blade.... 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Two skeletons in a gloomy forest, so there's a light fantasy theme to the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game only uses three keyboard keys. The countdown timer in the game is randomly generated between 1 and 4 seconds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game tests a player's reaction time, is a multiplayer experience, and served as a learning experience for me. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope it's a fun distraction for two competitive friends. A game equivalent of a snack. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Two players have their own button on the keyboard that they have to press. You have to press the button quicker than your opponent but press too soon and you'll die an agonizing second death. Pressing 'R' starts the first round and also restarts the game for subsequent plays. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players may try and feint pressing the button or try and ditract their opponent outside of the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Two skeletal necromancers meet each other in a forest and engage in a lethal staring contest. Perhaps they knew each other when they were both still made of flesh. But it matters not. They are tense with concentration for they know a single misstep will be a fatal one. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game targets fans of skeletons. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A single round only takes a few seconds. 
</li>
