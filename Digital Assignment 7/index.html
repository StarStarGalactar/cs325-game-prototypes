<h2>In Between The Lines</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? It is a 1v2 game where a player tries to pass on a secret message. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? The game uses twine in order to create a multiplayer, interactive story. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
That easiest part was implementing the html file to the webpage. The hardest part was keeping track of the conditionals that determined how the game flows. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
The game uses the Twine game creation tool which can be found here http://twinery.org/. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
The game does not borrow code in the strict sense but uses the aforementioned tool to create the game. Some of the mechanics bear a resemblance to the board game Decrypto. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game. A hostage must convey a message to an inspector while being sabotaged by a criminal.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used. Hostage taking has been a popular theme since the hit film "Taken". 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype. The aiming and shooting are controlled with the mouse cursor. The devils are generated from the bottom of screen and can spawn at any point along the bottom. The game can be described as an arcade shooter like Missile Command. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? Branching text passages. The ruleset for what players can say or not say. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? I want players to panic and repent for their past sins. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype. The game plays like a text adventure that takes user inputs.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game? The hostage takes on most of the burden of trying to create intelligent answers that can withstand the criminal's redactions. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension? The inspector works for the bureacracy in a technological dystopia. They hold someone's life in their hands but do they know that? 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach. People who like playing janky social games. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play? Depending on the playgroup, the game can last anywhere between 10 minutes and an hour. The length is determined by the inspector player.
